\section*{Fonction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This function computes the "orthotropic" diffusion coefficient at the faces. This type of coefficient is found for the diffusion of $R_{\,ij}$ and
$\varepsilon$ in $R_{\,ij}-\varepsilon$ ( {\it cf.} \fort{cs\_turbulence\_rij}), as well as for the pressure correction in the algorithm with enhanced velocity-pressure coupling (\fort{cs\_pressure\_correction}).

This coefficient involves the value of the face viscosity multiplied by the ratio of the face surface area to the algebraic distance $\overline{I'J'}$, a ratio resulting from the integration of the diffusion term.
The value of the face viscosity is based either on an arithmetic mean or on a harmonic mean of the viscosity at the cell centers.

See the \doxygenfile{cs\_face\_orthotropic\_viscosity\_vector_8f90.html}{programmers reference of the dedicated subroutine} for further details.

Figure \ref{Base_Visort_fig_geom} summarizes the various geometric definitions
for internal faces and boundary faces. \begin{figure}[h]

The integration of the ``orthotropic'' diffusion term on a cell is as follows:
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega_i}\dive \,(\tens{\mu}\ \grad f)\,d\Omega =\sum\limits_{j \in
Vois(i)}( \tens{\mu}\ \grad f)_{\,ij}\,.\,\underline{S}_{\,ij} + \sum\limits_{k \in
\gamma_b(i)}( \tens{\mu}\ \grad f)_{\,b_{ik}}\,.\,\underline{S}_{\,b_{ik}}
\end{equation}
with :
\begin{equation}
\tens{\mu}=\begin{bmatrix}\mu_x & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \mu_y & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \mu_z \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
And :
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
&\underline{S}_{\,ij} = S_{\,ij} \underline{n}_{\,ij} \\
&\underline{S}_{\,b_{ik}} = S_{\,b_{ik}} \underline{n}_{\,b_{ik}}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
The term $(\tens{\mu}\ \grad(f))_{\,ij}\underline{n}_{\,ij}$ is calculated using the following decomposition:
\begin{equation}
(\tens{\mu}\ \grad f)_{\,ij} = (\grad f \,.\,\underline{n}_{\,ij})\ \tens{\mu}\
\underline{n}_{\,ij}+
(\grad f .\underline{\tau}_{ij})\ \tens{\mu}\ \underline{\tau}_{\,ij}
\end{equation}
where $\underline{\tau}_{ij}$ represents a (unit) tangent vector to the face. A similar decomposition is used for boundary faces.
In the matrix, only the term
$(\grad f \,.\,\underline{n}_{\,ij})\ \tens{\mu}\ \underline{n}_{\,ij}$ is
easily implicitly integrable. Therefore, the part projected onto $\underline{\tau}_{\,ij}$
is:
\begin{itemize}
\item neglected in the case of calculating time scales related to the enhanced velocity-pressure coupling,
\item treated explicitly in the diffusion terms of
$R_{\,ij}-\varepsilon$ (\emph{cf.} \fort{cs\_turbulence\_rij}).\\
\end{itemize}
The implicit integration of the diffusion term is written:
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega_i}\dive\,(\tens{\mu}\ \grad f )\,d\Omega = \sum\limits_{j \in
Vois(i)}(\tens{\mu}\ \underline{n}_{\,ij})\,.\,\underline{S}_{\,ij}\,
\frac{f_{J'}-f_{I'}}{\overline{I'J'}} + \sum\limits_{k \in
\gamma_b(i)}(\tens{\mu}\ \underline{n}_{\,b_{ik}})\,.\,\underline{S}_{\,b_{ik}}
\,\frac{f_{\,b_{ik}}-f_{I'}}{\overline{I'F}}
\end{equation}
In this function, we calculate the term
$\displaystyle \frac{(\tens{\mu}\
\underline{n}_{\,ij})\,.\,\underline{S}_{\,ij}}{\overline{I'J'}}$ using the
formula:
\begin{equation}\notag
(\tens{\mu}\ \underline{n}_{\,ij})\,.\,\underline{n}_{\,ij} =
\mu_{\,ij}^{\,av}=\mu_{\,ij}^{\,x} ( n_{\,ij}^{\,x})^2 + \mu_{\,ij}^{\,y} (n_{\,ij}^{\,y})^2 + \mu_{\,ij}^{\,z}(n_{\,ij}^{\,z})^2
\end{equation}
either again:
\begin{equation}\notag
\mu_{\,ij}^{\,av}=\frac{\mu_{\,ij}^{\,x}
(S_{\,ij}^{\,x})^2 + \mu_{\,ij}^{\,y} (S_{\,ij}^{\,y})^2 +
\mu_{\,ij}^{\,z} (S_{\,ij}^{\,z})^2}{S_{\,ij}^2}
\end{equation}
At the boundary, we similarly compute:
\begin{equation}\notag
\displaystyle \frac{(\tens{\mu}\
\underline{n}_{\,b_{ik}})\,.\,\underline{S}_{\,b_{ik}}}{\overline{I'F}}
\end{equation}

with:
\begin{equation}\notag
(\tens{\mu}\ \underline{n}_{\,b_{ik}})\,.\,\underline{n}_{\,b_{ik}} =
\mu_{\,b_{ik}}^{\,moy} = \displaystyle \frac{\mu_{I}^{\,x}
(S_{\,b_{ik}}^{\,x})^2 + \mu_{I}^{\,y} (S_{\,b_{ik}}^{\,y})^2 +
\mu_{I}^{\,z} (S_{\,b_{ik}}^{\,z})^2}{S_{\,b_{ik}}^2}
\end{equation}

The viscosity value in a direction $l$ on the face, $\mu_{\,ij}^{\,l}$,
is computed
\begin{itemize}
\item either by linear interpolation:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\,ij}^{\,l}=\alpha_{\,ij}\mu_{i}^{\,l}+(1-\alpha_{\,ij})\mu_{j}^{\,l}
\end{equation}
with $\alpha_{\,ij}= 0.5$ because this choice seems stabilizing, even though
this interpolation is of spatial convergence order 1.
\item either by harmonic interpolation:
\begin{equation}\notag
\mu_{\,ij}^{\,l}=\displaystyle
\frac{\mu_{i}^{\,l}\ \mu_{j}^{\,l}}{\alpha_{\,ij}\mu_{i}^{\,l}+(1-\alpha_{\,ij}) \mu_{j}^{\,l}}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}\notag
\displaystyle \alpha_{\,ij}=\frac{\overline{FJ'}}{\overline{I'J'}}
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Implementation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The orthotropic viscosity at the cell center is entered as an argument {\it via}
the variables $\var{W}_1$, $\var{W}_2$, and $\var{W}_3$. The mean value of the viscosity at each face
is calculated in a arithmetic or harmonic manner. Next, we compute the equivalent viscosity corresponding to
$\displaystyle (\tens{\mu}\ \underline{n}_{\,ij})\,.\,\frac{\underline{S}_{\,ij}}{\overline{I'J'}}$ for the internal faces and to $\displaystyle (\tens{\mu}\ \underline{n}_{\,b_{ik}})\,.\,
\frac{\underline{S}_{\,b_{ik}}}{\overline{I'F}}$ for the boundary faces.\\

This formula uses the face normal vectors and surfaces,
and the algebraic distance \var{dist} for an internal face (or \var{distbr} for a boundary face).
The value of the resulting diffusion term is placed in the vector \var{visc} (\var{viscb} at the boundary).
The variable \var{imvisf} determines what type of averaging is used to calculate the viscosity in
a direction at the face. If \var{imvisf}=0, then
the averaging is arithmetic, otherwise the averaging is harmonic.

The derivation of interpolations used in the \CS\ code in paragraph
\ref{Base_Visort_paragraphe2} is summarized in the report by Davroux et al.\footnote{Davroux A., Archambeau F., and HÃ©rard J.M., Numerical tests on some methods for solving a diffusion equation in finite volumes,
HI-83/00/027/A.}. The authors of this report showed that, for an irregular one-dimensional mesh with non-constant viscosity, the measured convergence is of order 2 in space with harmonic interpolation and of order 1 in space with linear interpolation (for regular solutions). Therefore, it would be preferable to use harmonic interpolation to calculate the face viscosity value. Stability tests will be necessary beforehand.
Similarly, we can consider extrapolating the viscosity on the boundary faces rather than
using the viscosity value of the cell adjacent to that face.
In the case of the arithmetic mean, the use of the value $0.5$ for the $\alpha_{\,ij}$ coefficients should be reconsidered.
